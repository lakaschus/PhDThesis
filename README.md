# PhDThesis

This repository contains most of the code that has been used to generate the results of my doctoral thesis, which can be found here: http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/62534

- FRG: Contains Jupyter python notebooks for solving the FRG flow equations and a Mathematica script for the derivation of the analytic flow equation for the two-point function.
- KTSchemeTestCases: Contains test cases for the finite-volume scheme used in this thesis.
- NJLModelMF: Contains python scripts for the minimization of the grand potential of the NJL model with two-flavor color superconductivity and inhomogeneous chiral condensates.
